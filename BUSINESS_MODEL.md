## Marketing (Zero Budget Required)

1. **Reddit** - Share free tools in relevant subreddits
2. **Twitter/X** - Build in public, share progress
3. **YouTube** - Quick tool demos (5 min videos)
4. **SEO** - Each tool page ranks for its niche
5. **Word of mouth** - Good tools get shared

---

## Competitive Advantage

1. **Speed** - You can ship a tool in a day
2. **Breadth** - 50 tools beats 1 perfect tool
3. **Niche focus** - Big companies won't build "PSA Card Finder"
4. **Personal touch** - You built it, you support it
5. **AI-assisted** - You + Cursor = 10x output

## Success Metrics

| Metric | 6 Month Target | 12 Month Target |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Tools built | 20 | 50 |
| Email subscribers | 500 | 2,000 |
| Paying subscribers | 50 | 200 |
| Monthly revenue | $500 | $2,500 |
| Custom projects | 2 | 6 |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| No one pays | Keep costs near zero, validate before building |
| Tool breaks | Simple tools = less breakage |
| Competition | Niche down, move fast |
| Burnout | Only build what interests you |
| Tech changes | Python/Streamlit are stable, transferable skills |

---

## Exit Options (If You Want Them)

1. **Keep running** - Semi-passive income forever
2. **Sell portfolio** - Micro-SaaS portfolios sell for 3-5x annual revenue
3. **Get hired** - Portfolio proves you ship
4. **Partner up** - Find someone to run it while you build
5. **Expand one tool** - If something hits, go big on it

## The Core Philosophy

> **"Ship small, ship fast, let winners emerge."**

You don't need to know which tool will succeed. Build 50, and 2-3 will carry the business. The others are portfolio pieces and learning.
